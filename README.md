# Python-Type-In-Calculator
Hi,
this program is a simple python script which lets you choose an operation and then lets you type in operators.

OPERATION SELECTION:
Once you load the program, you have to choose between 1 and 6 to use an operation.
Ex. 1 = summation, 2 = subtraction ecc.

OPEARATORS:
After selecting the operation you can proceed typing in the operators.
Note: every operation can only use 2 operators except for the square root, which index is already set to 2.

Enjoy, feedback is appreciated.
Also, new version(operators and then operation, gui(?)) is coming soon.
